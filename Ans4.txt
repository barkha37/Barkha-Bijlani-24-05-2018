4. Prepare a Jenkins pipeline job (DSL / groovy script) to satisfy following CI-Cd pipeline : 
 •	Send approval email to Release Manager after the application packaging phase  
 •	Trigger the Jenkins job  on reception of the approval email for the above job . 
 
 
 Solution: 
 This could be achieved, by using "Workflow Plugin" through groovy script: 
 
 
 stage 'build'  
 node { 
 git 'https://github.com/cloudbees/todo-api.git' withEnv(["PATH+MAVEN=${tool 'm3'}/bin"]) { 
 sh "mvn -B –Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true clean package" 
 	} 
 } 
 stage 'unit-test' 
 node { 
 sh "mvn clean verify"  
 } 
 stage 'code-quality' 
 node { 
 sh "mvn sonar:sonar"  
 } 
 stage 'approve' 
 node { 
    // We need to wait for input from manager, 
    // sending an email for approval 
 mail (to: 'release.manager@zycus.com', 
    subject: "Job '${env.JOB_NAME}' (${env.BUILD_NUMBER}) is waiting for approval", 
    body: "Please go to ${env.BUILD_URL}."); 
 timeout(time: 1, unit: 'DAYS') { 
 input message: 'Approve if you wish to deploy?', submitter: 'manager' 
 	} 
 } 
 stage name:'deploy', concurrency: 1 
 node { 
 sh "mvn cargo:deploy" 
 echo "deployed"  
 }

2. How can you establish a connection between two or many different Jenkins jobs (hosted on distinct servers) to pass the parameters / upstream - downstream jobs etc ..( without using Master-Slave connection in a secured way) 
 
 
Solution: This can be done through 2 ways: 
 
a) For such case, we can use “Parameterized Trigger Plugin”. –> https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin.

 Once this plugin is installed , go to Job 1(upstream job) > Post-Build Actions > Select ”Trigger parameterized build on other projects” 
 
 Under this plugin, in the predefined parameters section mention the parameter you wish to pass. 
 For Example, I need to pass "USER_NAME": 
 
 Temp=${USER_NAME} 
 
 In the Downstream Job: To access this parameter use $Temp where you need it. Let's say, in the Editable Email Notification section. 
 
 
b) Another way to achieve this is by using "Workflow plugin". 
  
 Here you can pass a groovy script and make a connection between two or more jenkins jobs. For Example: 
 
 def job = build job: 'sample-job', parameters: [[$class: 'StringParameterValue', name: 'user', value: 'Gaurav'
